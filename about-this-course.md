# What this course IS

A one-month short course from [Code Your Future](https://codeyourfuture.io/)

You get a taste of programming with JavaScript - one of the most popular programming languages today - and you get to find out if you like programming!

You'll become familiar with some free on-line resources that we recommend to help in future study

### About further study on CYF's web-development course:

At the end of this short course,

* if you decide programming's definitely for you

* and if we think you're ready

there will be the possibility to apply for further study on the next full-stack web development course.

Whether you take that path or not, we want this course to be useful to you.

## What this course is NOT

### It's *not* a web development course
    * Although we'll certainly learn some JavaScript - the most popular language in web development - we won't do *any* web development with it!
 
### It's *not* a teacher-led course

We're not going to lecture you.

You will work through some online courses, and we (or the people sitting around you) will help you when you're really stuck.

### â€¦ and we're *not* starting with JavaScript!

We'll start to look at JavaScript in week 2.  First we're going to use a simpler language to learn and practice fundamentals.
