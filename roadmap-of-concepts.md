| Order matters                         | Yes.  turn left then forwards, or forward then turn left?  | Yes |
| | | |

| | | |
| Repetition with "loops"               | Yes (repeat n times, repeat until, [while nectar > 0](https://studio.code.org/s/course3/stage/13/puzzle/7)) | Yes                          |
| | | |
| nested loops                          | Yes [example: 11.5](https://studio.code.org/s/course3/stage/11/puzzle/5)                     |                              |
| | | |
| Functions | | |
| Using ("calling") a function          | Yes, [move forwards](https://studio.code.org/s/course3/stage/2/puzzle/1)                     | Yes                          |
| Passing information to a function     | Yes: [move forward by 100 pixels](https://studio.code.org/s/course3/stage/21/puzzle/2) | Yes                  |
| | | |
| More Functions | | |
| Defining your own functions           | Yes [e.g. "get 7 make 7"](https://studio.code.org/s/course3/stage/6/puzzle/8?section_id=2217957)                     | Yes                          |
| returning information from a function | No | |
| | | |
| Variables | Not much. [set color red](https://studio.code.org/s/course3/stage/3/puzzle/4?section_id=2217957) | |
| | | |
| Data Types                            | No                       | Partially                   |
| | | |
| Arrays and Objects                    |No                        |Yes                          |
| | | |
| Event handlers | Yes ["When up pressed"](https://studio.code.org/s/course3/stage/15/puzzle/8?section_id=2217957) | |
