# Tips for success in the class

## Tip: Don't hide when you don't know.

* It is normal not to know things in this industry.
* The volunteers can't help you if we don't know you are lost.

## Tip: The objective is to learn, NOT to complete the exercises

Completion of all exercises is not success.  If you learn so that you can complete any *future exercises* without help (e.g. in a job interview), *that* is success.

## Tip: Each exercise is an *opportunity to learn* - don't let anyone steal that from you

When getting help, stay in control (of the computer and the process)

Don't let someone rob you of the opportunity to learn by solving your problem for you.  Completing it without understanding is a waste of your time and ours.

If you've done something in group-work that you don't fully understand:
 * slow things down, 
 * get it explained, 
 * or go back to it after and challenge yourself to understand it, but
 
*Don't let it go!* The next time you don't understand something, it will be harder to get things explained.

Take notes about what you don't understand (at minimum, the exercise numbers), and revisit them even after you've completed them once or twice, until you're positive you understand.

## Tip: Try _prediction_, to get all the juice out of each exercise!

* Always try to *predict* what code will do before you run it.  Write your prediction down, or tell your team mate - make it a game.  After you run the program, discuss why your guess was wrong, if it was.

With simple challenges, it is easy to just repeatedly modify and re-run your program until it works, but you won't learn as much unless you are *thinking*.
