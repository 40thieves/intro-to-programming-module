# Tips for success in the class

## Tip: Don't hide when you don't know.

* It is *normal* not to know things in this industry
* The volunteers can't help you if we don't know you are lost
* Probably someone else in the class has the same question as you, and is too scared to ask.
* If the teacher asks if everyone understands, SAY if you have doubts.

## Tip: Don't be frustrated when a volunteer does not solve your problem for you

The teachers have told them not to!  Because...

## Tip: The objective is to learn, NOT to complete the exercises

Completion of all exercises is *not* success... if you do not truly understand.  

If you learn so that you can complete any *future exercises* without help (e.g. in a job interview), *that* is success.

## Tip: When getting help, stay in control (of the computer and the process)

Each exercise is an *opportunity to learn* - don't let anyone steal that from you by solving your problem.  Completing the exercise without understanding is a *waste of your time and ours*.

## Tip: In group-work, seek to understand everything

If you've done something in group-work that you don't fully understand:
 * slow things down
 * get it explained
 * go back to it after by yourself, and challenge yourself to understand it
 
*Don't let it go* because the next time you don't understand something, it will be harder to get things explained.

So if you solve 10 exercises together in a group-work exercise, it is a great idea to go back over and try to solve them yourself the next day.

## Tip: Take notes about what you don't understand

At a minimum, take note of the exercise numbers that you have problems with, even if you solve them eventually.  Then you should revisit them some time afterwards and complete them again from scratch until you're positive you understand.

## Tip: Try _prediction_, to get all the juice out of each exercise!

With simple programming challenges, it is easy to just repeatedly modify and re-run your program until it works, but you won't learn much unless you are *thinking* (and this playful approach doesn't work in industry with more complicated problems), so instead...

* Always try to *predict* what your code will do before you run it.  Write your prediction down, or tell your team mate - you can make it a game.  After you run the program, if your guess was wrong, discuss why, FIND OUT why.
