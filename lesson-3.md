# Intro to Programming 3

## Intro to JS

You've been introduced to JavaScript in the Khan Academy course, now we'll build on that to show more of JavaScript.

## Microbit Workshop

Microbits are tiny computers that you can program to turn on and off coloured lights and even play music. They are a fun way to learn programming! Neill will give a short workshop on how to use and program them.

## Help with Homework Exercises

Another opportunity to ask questions about last week's homework. If you would like some assistance on any of the exercises, the teaching assistants will be available to help.

## Pairing session

Each student will have a pairing session with one of the instructors to solve a programming problem using the Khan Academy Intro to JavaScript environment.
