# Intro to Programming 3

## Khan Academy Projects

The Khan Academy course includes some _projects_. Pick your 2 favourite projects and think about how you would improve them. Maybe you want to add more food to the dinner plate. We'll be working in groups to help make those changes together. The teaching assistants will also be available to help your group if you're stuck.

## Pairing session

Each student will have a pairing session with one of the instructors to solve a programming problem using the Khan Academy Intro to JavaScript environment.

## Homework
