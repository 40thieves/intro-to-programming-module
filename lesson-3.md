# Intro to Programming 3

## Warm up game

Some students will teach zip zap boing to the others.

## Introductions

As you'll have seen during the game, we have new volunteers today!  Let's make sure we know each other!  Ask for a name tag if you don't already have one.

## Shout out your questions

Let's make a list of all of the programming questions we'd like to get answered today, and put them on the whiteboard.

During the break we'd also like you to add your initials next to the questions that interest you the most.

Mentor notes: have a volunteer write up the questions (e.g. as https://gist.github.com/) and share.

## Present your favourite project to your classmates

You will give a very, very simple 2 minute presentation to 2 or 3 other students and a volunteer (if one is available).

5 minutes to prep:

Pick your favourite project (or the one that's most interesting to talk about) and get ready to explain:
* what you added to it
* what was difficult
* what you like and don't like about it
* what you would add if you had time
* Any parts of the code you still don't understand and might want help with

With your table-mates, find a quiet space in the allowed areas, and set a stopwatch for 2 minutes.  First presenter to go ahead:
* Present to your classmates, not just to the volunteer
* cover the above points
* speak clearly
* face the people you're talking to, as much as possible.  Don't just face the screen
* try to make it fun!
* stick to the time.  The volunteer will cut you off at 2 minutes! 
* don't go into too much detail on one point - 2 minutes is NOT much time at all.

## 1-to-1 with volunteers: critical questions for getting unstuck

We'll now spend 30 minutes where you can ask the volunteers with help on serious *questions that have really been blocking your progress* through the khan academy course.

If you have other more advanced questions that aren't blocking you, please don't ask them yet (unless you see that the volunteers are clearly not busy helping with more fundamental issues).  We'll have time later for those questions.

## Khan Academy Projects

The Khan Academy course includes some _projects_. Pick your 2 favourite projects and think about how you would improve them. Maybe you want to add more food to the dinner plate. We'll be working in groups to help make those changes together. The teaching assistants will also be available to help your group if you're stuck.

### Pair-programming (2 students)

It's good to code with a friend.  You learn SO much.  Many professional teams program in pairs for a part of each day.

We'll talk VERY briefly about what pair-programming is (2 minutes) and how you can do it.

Then we'll all have a chance to work on a khan academy project in a pair.

Some notes:
* Pick a partner who is roughly at your level and ideally who is interested in a similar programming task (e.g. animating a fish, or improving the text on an Ad Design project)
* *Define a small task clearly* that you are both happy to work on together.  You need clarity or you may be "pulling in two different directions".  Example dialog:
   * "Well, I'd like to add a column of bubbles above each fish."
   * "Yes, I like that idea"
   * "But let's not try to animate them, at least not in this first task?"
   * "Yep, let's keep it simple!  Once we've got them showing up correctly, we can decide what's next!"
   * "So, just like.. 5 bubbles spaced out in a vertical line above the front of each fish?"
   * "Let's do it! :)"
   * ... they are successful
   * "hmm, maybe let's add a little randomness to their position so it looks more natural"
   * "ooh, sounds good. i don't know how to do that"
   * "well, it's your turn on the keyboard now, anyway.  i'll talk you through it.  do you know what the random() function does?"
   * ...

* Switch between "driver " and "navigator" roles every 10 minutes.
* Don't dominate - this is teamwork.  Even when you're in charge of the keyboard you are not in charge of all the decisions. Try to find agreement with your team-members.  
    * If you think you know more and better than your teammate then take the opportunity to help them learn.  The more they do, the more decisions they make, the more chance they'll have to reflect and learn.
* Defend yourself.  Some partners will try to dominate and rule the keyboard or dictate every decision.  Take your turn at the keyboard, and speak up when you have ideas.  Ask for your partner to slow down if they're going too fast or to explain if they are adding code you don't understand.  Take responsibility for gaining that understanding, and ask for help from your partner in getting there.
    
*I'm stressing out!*
This will only be a short (20-30 minutes) pairing task, so don't stress if you find don't get on with your partner.  This happens to professionals, and employers REALLY care how you behave in a pairing session, so treat it as important practice, and try to find a way to get on.  
Often this stress can arise between two dominant personalities both of whom think they are right.  If this is your case it might be clever for you to let the other person make more of the decisions.

mentor notes:

* volunteers to call out to switch navigator and driver roles every 10 minutes loosely
* don't run the session too long.  stressful for some.

#### reflect on pair-programming
* two minutes
* easy/hard?
* advantages? disadvantages?
* any tips?
* in perspective: this happens in industry and in coding interviews.  we'll keep practicing.

You will be free (and encouraged) to work like this in some of the sessions this afternoon.  Provided you follow the guidelines above (importantly, there is *driver* and *navigator* there is no *back seat* to fall asleep in.

#### Super super important rule for this course and other courses

If you are working in a pair (or team) so that you can hide what you don't understand but you think it is ok because the team are getting the work done, you are failing yourself.  Hiding like this is one of the few ways to genuinely mess up.

SHOW what you don't understand, and get help with it.  Find a team to work in that is at YOUR level, and work on a simpler task that is one you fully understand, at your speed.

# Lunch

# After lunch

Continue with your chosen khan academy projects either in pairs or individually or for short sessions of each.

During this time, you should seek help from the volunteers about your specific questions.

## Common questions - Live coding

The teacher will do some live-coding to demonstrate solutions to some of the class's common questions.  

Can you spot the teacher's coding mistakes before they do?

They might ask you to do some of the coding for the class, please contribute and don't worry about mistakes, they are normal!

Certainly they'll ask you to contribute suggestions for possible solutions - speak up, that is how you help the teacher.  There is no one correct way.

*Tip*: Help us: A quiet class with no questions or suggestions is a difficult class for a volunteer to teach

## pairing task with instructors

Each student will have a pairing session with one of the instructors to solve a programming problem using the Khan Academy Intro to JavaScript environment.

## Homework

See google classroom for the definitive list of homework assignments.
