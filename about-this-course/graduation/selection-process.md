# Selection Process

In this document you will find the selection process that can be followed to choose who should move from the Fundamentals to the Full Stack course.

As with everything at CodeYourFuture you are welcome to edit, remix and change this as necessary to fit your specific circumstance. You are fully in control of this process. 

## Fundamentals Aims

It's worth restating the aims of the Fundamentals Modules from our point of view. 

At it's core, this module has been created to bring the majority of our students up to the same level before they progress on to the main course. However it is also great to dig deeper into

* How committed people are to the course
* How well people self teach
* How people ask for help when they need it
* How well they fit into our community

Our Interviews will never be able to give us the insight we need to choosing the people who think are most likely to succeed on our course. 

## Process

### Selection Spreadsheet

To begin, create a copy of this template spreadsheet

[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xoDbP8P4hD3iuovHkd\_zmFkKMHLhsXa3U6Pa7YUjZyc/edit\#gid=0](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xoDbP8P4hD3iuovHkd_zmFkKMHLhsXa3U6Pa7YUjZyc/edit#gid=0)

Spend some time investigating each of the categories and filling in the spreadsheet with as much visibility as you have. The most details you can add to that sheet the better.

You are welcome to add and remove columns as you see fit from your copy of the spreadsheet.

Each section is as follows

* Attendance
  * As a percentage, how many of the lessons did the student attend
  * Do not include lessons that the student missed with a valid excuse \(e.g. sickness, technical issues\)
* Punctuality
  * As a percentage, how many of the lessons did the student attend
  * Do not include lessons that the student missed with a valid excuse \(e.g. sickness, technical issues\)
* Code.org Completed
  * How much of the Code.org has this student completed.
  * This is the homework for Week 1
* KhanAcademy Completed
  * How much of the Code.org has this student completed.
  * This is the homework for Week 2,3,4
* Learning Online Completed
  * How much of the Learning Online tutorial has the student completed
  * This is the homework for Week 2, 3, 4
* Slack Interaction
  * How much did the student interact on Slack over the course
  * This includes starting calls, joining calls, asking questions, answering questions and general conversation
* Week 2 Challenge
  * How well did the student do on the [Three Giraffes](../../teacher-resources/instructor-notes-1.md#1-to-1-assessment) challenge
* Week 3 Challenge
  * How well did the student do on the [Three Cars](../../teacher-resources/instructor-notes-2.md#1-to-1-assessment) challenge
* Week 4 Challenge
  * How well did the student do on the [Box & Ribbons](../../teacher-resources/instructor-notes-2.md#1-to-1-assessment) challenge

### Selection

#### Homework & Attendance Pass

As a first pass, find the people that we are sure are not ready for the course. This is people who

* Have not shown any commitment to the course
* Have not completed most of the homework

#### Technical Pass

The second pass is about finding student who didn't make the technical process that we would have hoped on the course.

Did any of the students stand out as performing poorly on then technical challenges that they should be removed from the process.

This is people who 

* Score very poorly in their 1-to-1s

Scoring poorly means

* They did not show they had learnt over the four week course
* They could not apply the learning from KhanAcademy to the 1-to-1s

#### Soft Skills Development Pass
