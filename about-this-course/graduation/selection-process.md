# Selection Process

In this document you will find the selection process that can be followed to choose who should move from the Fundamenals to the Full Stack course.

As with everything at CodeYourFuture you are welcome to edit, remix and change this as necessary to fit your specific circumstance. You are fully in control of this process. 

## Fundamentals Aims

It's worth restating the aims of the Fundamentals Modules from our point of view. 

At it's core, this module has been created to bring the majority of our students up to the same level before they progress on to the main course. However it is also great to dig deeper into

* How committed people are to the course
* How well people self teach
* How people ask for help when they need it
* How well they fit into our community

Our Interviews will never be able to give us the insight we need to choosing the people who think are most likely to suceed on our course.
