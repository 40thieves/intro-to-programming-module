# Class Preparation

Congratulations on being selected to join CodeYourFuture Fundamentals of Tech course!

We know you are excited for the classes to start!

You need to do some preparation now so you are ready and able to participate fully in this course. You might find it helpful to print this page. Check off each task as you complete it, so you know you are ready to come to work on day one.

## 1. Working Agreement \(15 minutes\)

Please **read** the CodeYourFuture [Student Agreement](https://docs.codeyourfuture.io/organisation/agreements-and-rules/student-agreement).

Make a note of anything you don’t understand or don’t agree with. We will be discussing it in class so everyone knows what they are agreeing to.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you have any questions, please contact your city coordinator.
{% endhint %}

* [x] I have read the [Student Agreement](https://docs.codeyourfuture.io/organisation/agreements-and-rules/student-agreement).

## 2. Hardware Check \(20 minutes\)

* [x] I have a working laptop or desktop **computer.**
* [x] I have a stable **internet** connection.
* [x] I have a **webcam**.

{% hint style="info" %}

{% endhint %}

## 3. Professional Accounts \(2 hours\)

Download and install the following software or register for the apps.

Click on the links to go to the registration pages. **Keep your login details for all sites/apps consistent and always use your real name.**

{% hint style="success" %}
CYF recognises **you may need to keep your birth name private**. When we say real name, we mean the name you go by.  It does not have to match your birth certificate or any other legal document. It has to be consistent and professional.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
CYF understands you may need to keep your picture off the internet. In this case, generate [a robohash picture](https://robohash.org/GermanBencci?set=set3) from your name, and use that for all these accounts. Use your [robohash](https://robohash.org/) consistently and it will help us recognise each other.  
{% endhint %}

### 3.1 Gmail, Google Account

Make a new Google account. Use your real name. Don’t use any numbers or words that are not your name. Never put the year of your birth in your professional email address. Your email address should look something like this:

{% hint style="info" %}
GBencci@example.com
{% endhint %}

**This is your public professional email address.** Use it to sign up for all your professional accounts ****unless you can use your Github. Put it in your Slack profile.
