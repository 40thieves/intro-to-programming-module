# Before the course begins

You can do so much to improve your chances of success with Code Your Future and you can start right now. Before the course begins, work through these resources to get yourself prepared, powerful, and ready to work. You can do this.

### Prep 1 : Grasshopper

You may have done Fundamentals 1 on Grasshopper, but what about Fundamentals 2? What other courses can you unlock? The _Using a Code Editor course_ could be handy for Prep 2.

### Prep 2 : Developer Tools

Download [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and practice using a real developer environment. You don't need to write any code in your new IDE. Just find out where the buttons are and what some of them do.
