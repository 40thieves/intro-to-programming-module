## Assessments

Several assessments have been designed for this module. They should be completed during the in-person class.

### 10 minute assessments

The goal of these assessments is to assess how well the material is being taught. Based on the results of the assessment, the instructors can decide whether some subjects need to be revisited. Consider whether they could be approached in a different way.

They should take no more than 10 minutes to run.

### Pairing assessments

The goal of these assessments is to assess how well the student is progressing. Based on the outcome of the assessment, the instructor(s) can decide whether the student has a good understanding of the subject.

A volunteer should be assigned to sit down with 1 student at a time to "pair" on a small task. It is however not quite like normal pairing: the volunteer should aim to not "give away" the answer. If the student is struggling the volunteer can ask open questions to provide a suggestion.
