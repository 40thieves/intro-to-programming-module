## Assessments

Several assessments have been designed for this module. They should be completed during the in-person class.

### Misc feedback from any volunteer

* Even for small but significant interactions, volunteers should be encouraged to fill out [this feedback form](https://forms.gle/GgpFkgKCRPVtTtrJ7). It's fine to skip bits of it - there's a free text section at the end.
* For form administrators, that's [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/13F6J1HiBvmxZy-cSrgDwVxpVAZPdjU3Rv2wsXIpmo_M/edit)

### 1-to-1 assessments

The goal of these assessments is to assess how well the student is progressing. Based on the outcome of the assessment, the instructor(s) can decide whether the student has a good understanding of the subject.

A volunteer should be assigned to sit down with 1 student at a time to "pair" on a small task. It is however not quite like normal pairing: the volunteer should aim to not "give away" the answer. If the student is struggling the volunteer can ask open questions to provide a suggestion.
