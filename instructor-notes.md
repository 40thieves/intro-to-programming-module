# Instructor Notes

Notes for the instructors of this course.

## Equipment for running the course

* Wifi
* Screencasting
  * Some set-up for presenting your screen and live coding
  * Bring a spare if there's space for 2 rooms
  * A good, cheap solution is a Chromecast
* Power extensions/strips
  * Student laptops tend to have poor battery life
* Spare headphones
  * Useful video courses for week 2 onwards
* Blank stickers for name tags
* Attendance sheets
  * Clipboard might be useful too
* Whiteboard markers
* Post-its
* Paper/pens for making notes
* Spare laptops

### Pairing

In the lesson we ask the students to do some pair-programming. This is very likely to be the first time they have ever paired on a programming problem. Here are some tips on running a good pairing session:

* Assign a volunteer to call out to switch navigator and driver roles every 10 minutes loosely
  * Make sure the students actually switch!
* Monitor closely to check that one side isn't dominating
* Don't run the session too long - it is stressful for some
* Switch partners at least once (e.g. different partners before and after lunch)

## Khan Academy Notes

Student progress often won't be updated on your dashboard until as much as 5-10 minutes have passed

## Assessments

Several assessments have been designed for this module. They should be completed during the in-person class.

### Misc feedback from any volunteer

* Even for small but significant interactions, volunteers should be encouraged to fill out [this feedback form](https://forms.gle/GgpFkgKCRPVtTtrJ7). It's fine to skip bits of it - there's a free text section at the end.
* For form administrators, that's [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/13F6J1HiBvmxZy-cSrgDwVxpVAZPdjU3Rv2wsXIpmo_M/edit)

### 1-to-1 assessments

The goal of these assessments is to assess how well the student is progressing. Based on the outcome of the assessment, the instructor(s) can decide whether the student has a good understanding of the subject.

A volunteer should be assigned to sit down with 1 student at a time to "pair" on a small task. It is however not quite like normal pairing: the volunteer should aim to not "give away" the answer. If the student is struggling the volunteer can ask open questions to provide a suggestion.
