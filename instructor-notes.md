# Instructor Notes

Notes for the instructors of this course.

## Equipment for running the course

* Wifi
* Screencasting
  * Some set-up for presenting your screen and live coding
  * Bring a spare if there's space for 2 rooms
  * A good, cheap solution is a Chromecast
* Power extensions/strips
  * Student laptops tend to have poor battery life
* Spare headphones
  * Useful video courses for week 2 onwards
* Blank stickers for name tags
* Attendance sheets
  * Clipboard might be useful too
* Whiteboard markers
* Post-its
* Paper/pens for making notes
* Spare laptops

## Classroom Tips

### Write questions on a whiteboard

At the beginning of a lesson, it is good to get the students thinking about questions that they had during the week. To avoid getting distracted with answering a question for too long, run a short session where you write down all the questions on a whiteboard.

You can then prioritise answering the questions, or split into groups to answer several questions at once.

It is also useful to get a volunteer write up the questions in a more permanent place (e.g. [as a Gist](https://gist.github.com/)) and share on Slack.

### Pairing

In the lesson we ask the students to do some pair-programming. This is very likely to be the first time they have ever paired on a programming problem. Here are some tips on running a good pairing session:

* Assign a volunteer to call out to switch navigator and driver roles every 10 minutes loosely
  * Make sure the students actually switch!
* Monitor closely to check that one side isn't dominating
* Don't run the session too long - it is stressful for some
* Switch partners at least once (e.g. different partners before and after lunch)

## Kahoot

Kahoot is a web app for running quick, fun quizzes with the whole class.

A prepared quiz is [available here](https://play.kahoot.it/v2/?quizId=62bd599b-af55-41c3-b335-c28c9060c023). It is intended to get a general level of confidence in their programming ability from the class. To be able to compare we suggest running it in the first and last classes.

## Khan Academy Notes

- Student progress often won't be updated on your dashboard until as much as 5-10 minutes have passed

## Assessments

Several assessments have been designed for this module. They should be completed during the in-person class.

### Misc feedback from any volunteer

* Even for small but significant interactions, volunteers should be encouraged to fill out [this feedback form](https://forms.gle/GgpFkgKCRPVtTtrJ7). It's fine to skip bits of it - there's a free text section at the end.
* For form administrators, that's [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/13F6J1HiBvmxZy-cSrgDwVxpVAZPdjU3Rv2wsXIpmo_M/edit)


### 10 minute formative assessments

The goal of these assessments is to assess how well the material is being taught. Based on the results of the assessment, the instructors can decide whether some subjects need to be revisited. Consider whether they could be approached in a different way.

They should take no more than 10 minutes to run.

### Pairing assessments

The goal of these assessments is to assess how well the student is progressing. Based on the outcome of the assessment, the instructor(s) can decide whether the student has a good understanding of the subject.

A volunteer should be assigned to sit down with 1 student at a time to "pair" on a small task. It is however not quite like normal pairing: the volunteer should aim to not "give away" the answer. If the student is struggling the volunteer can ask open questions to provide a suggestion.
