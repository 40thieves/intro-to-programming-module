# Lesson 2

## Warm up activity \(30 minutes\)

A picture tells a story: Let's start our introductions with an image

1. Find an image online of an object that represents you or why are are on the course.  
2. Add the image to our Slack thread and an explanation of why you chose that particular object.  
3. Once you have completed your post, look at what other people have posted.
4. When you find any interesting images and ask that person a follow up question about it.
5. If somoene asks a question about your picture. Make sure you reply to their question with an answer

## What's your name? 

Let's make sure we know each other! Make sure your name is visible on Zoom. You can change your name by clicking the three dots on the right hand corner and clicking 'rename' .

If you are a CYF volunteer please add 'Vol or Volunteer' after your name. 

## Shout out your questions \(10 minutes\)

Let's make a list of all of the programming questions we'd like to get answered today, and put them on our virtual whiteboard. 

We like to use [Miro](https://miro.com/login/).   

1. Log into Miro \(your instructor will give you the link for your Miro Board\)
2. Find the sticky notes on the board.
3. Find the note you wrote your name on for your coursework assignment. 
4. Write your question on your note \(you must ask a question\)
5. If you have more than 1 question, write each on a separate stiky note. To add a new note, use the toolbar on the left hand side to select a new note.



## Solving problems \(60 minutes\)

Problem solving is a critical skill for programmers, including for experts. Often programmers spend most of their day solving problems in their code. Learning how to solve problems efficiently is an extremely useful skill.

To help develop your problem solving skills, we'll play a fun game in small groups. Followed by a short [presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1XzLUVxfiJE2llWTWn7Rf5T0cutcL9HCBwd09GBCzv_4/) about improving your problem solving.

## "Algorithm Recipe" Review \(30 Minutes\)

Last week you should have written a "algorithm recipe". The instructor will pick out a few of the best to read with the rest of the class. We'll see if there are any missing steps!

## Effective Communication \(1 Hour\)

Ok so working remotely \(online\) is differnt from working together face to face. We will look at how commuincation works online and get some tips on how to be more effective on this course.  

## Presentations \(30 minutes\)

For last week's coursework, you will have made a presentation about something you learned in the last week. Now is your chance to present it! We'll break into groups of 3 - 4 and take turns to present to the rest of your group for **5 minutes**.

Remember that communicating information to others is a really important skill for programmers. Here are some tips for your presentation:

* Look at your camera. Not the squares of faces on your screen. It will look like you are talking directly to your audience
* Make sure you are not on mute
* Speak clearly - check if everyone can hear you
* Try to make it fun!
* Stick to the time. The volunteer will cut you off at 5 minutes!

## Coursework In Perspective \(20 minutes\)

Although the block-based coding you practised at home solved only simple problems with a simple language, we'll look briefly at four concepts you used which are also at the heart of professional coding.

## Coursework Time \(120 minutes\)

### Help with Coursework Exercises 

This is your opportunity to ask questions about last week's assignments. If you would like some assistance on any of the exercises, the teaching assistants will be available to help.

### 1-to-1 programming problem with an instructor

Whilst you are getting help with your Coursework exercises, each student will have a work with one of the instructors to solve a programming problem using the Code.org block-programming environment.

## Coursework Assignments

### 1. Khan Academy: Intro to JS

We will be studying the [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org) Intro to JS course. This will give you an introduction to the JavaScript programming language which we will be using for the rest of the syllabus. To get set up follow these instructions:

1. Follow the instructions for registering a Khan Academy account provided by the instructors
2. Click on Courses under `My Stuff`
3. Choose `Adult learner` and go to the next step
4. Choose `Computer Programming` and continue
5. To the right of `Intro to JS: Drawing and Animation`, press Start
6. Click the "Start" button for the "What is Programming?" lesson
7. Read the instructions carefully and try to complete the exercises
8. Complete as many lessons as you can **AT LEAST UP TO** the ["Text and Strings" section](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming#text-basics). You can **SKIP** the "Becoming a community coder" section.
9. As soon as you complete any "project", make sure you submit it for evaluation immediately, to get feedback.

There will be some time in class to start the first exercises. Let the instructors know if you get stuck.

#### No headphones? Read the subtitles or video transcript

If you do not have headphones to watch the videos you can click on "CC" \(subtitles/closed captions\) in the video window, or underneath the video on "Transcript".

### 2. Learning How to Learn course

Continue to **Week 2** of the [Learning How to Learn course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn). It should take around 3 hours to complete.

What kind of communicator are you?

### 3. How to improve your workplace communication 

As we work together online it can be even more tricky to communicate effectively. Learn three ways you can improve how you send and receive messages here at CodeYourFuture and in your other workplaces. 

1. Read this [article on communication](https://www.loom.com/blog/improve-your-workplace-communication)
2. Watch the embedded video Karina's Communication and Work Style
3. After reading and watching the video, go back to **Step two: Determine how you communicate.** 
4. Think about the scenarios they present in this section
5. Write down how you would approach each scenario
6. Think about your preferred ways of communicating, the communication tools you rely on, and the things that annoy you about other's communication.
7. Using your answers for the above, try to write your own guide to your Communication style \( just this section, not your whole user manual! \). You can also have a go at recording a Loom video if you choose.
