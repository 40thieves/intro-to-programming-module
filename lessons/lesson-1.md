# Week 2

## Warm up activity \(30 minutes\)

A picture tells a story: Let's start our introductions with an image

1. Find an image online of an object that represents you or why are are on the course.  
2. Add the image to our Slack thread and an explanation of why you chose that particular object.  
3. Once you have completed your post, look at what other people have posted.
4. When you find any interesting images and ask that person a follow up question about it.
5. If someone asks a question about your picture. Make sure you reply to their question with an answer

## What's your name? 

Let's make sure we know each other! Make sure your name is visible on Zoom. You can change your name by clicking the three dots on the right hand corner and clicking 'rename' .

If you are a CYF volunteer please add 'Vol or Volunteer' after your name. 

## Shout out your questions \(10 minutes\)

\_\_[_Instructors see here for instructions_](../teacher-resources/instructor-notes-1.md#shout-out-questions)\_\_

Let's make a list of all of the programming questions we'd like to get answered today, and put them on our virtual whiteboard. 

We like to use [Miro](https://miro.com/login/).   

1. Log into Miro \(your instructor will give you the link for your Miro Board\)
2. Find the sticky notes on the board.
3. Find the note you wrote your name on for your coursework assignment. 
4. Write your question on your note \(you must ask a question\)
5. If you have more than 1 question, write each on a separate stiky note. To add a new note, use the toolbar on the left hand side to select a new note.

## Solving problems \(60 minutes\)

{% hint style="warning" %}
Volunteers, please [**read the setup**](../teacher-resources/instructor-notes-1.md#solving-problems-workshop) and resources for this workshop in [Teacher Resource](../teacher-resources/)s so your trainees can get the most out of it. Try playing it beforehand too!
{% endhint %}

Problem solving is a critical skill for programmers, including for experts. Often programmers spend most of their day solving problems in their code. Learning how to solve problems efficiently is an extremely useful skill.

To help develop your problem solving skills, we'll play a fun game in small groups called...

### **Blockers!** 

[**Online Version of this game**](https://www.dr-mikes-math-games-for-kids.com/online-traffic-jam-game.html) ****

#### **Objectives**

* Share your screen
* Identify the blocker
* Use driver and navigator pattern
* Break down a problem into steps
* Negotiate a strategy with your team
* Follow directions

### **Exercise - 30 minutes**

In groups or breakout rooms of 4 trainees maximum.

One person will share their screen and be the **driver**. The driver can only move the pieces where you are told by the navigators. The driver cannot make any decisions!

The others will be the **navigators**. Together, the navigators must figure out a strategy to unblock the car, and tell the driver how to do it!  
  
**Each person must drive,** so set a timer for ****[**5 minutes per round**](https://www.google.com/search?q=set+a+timer+for+5+minutes) ****and then swap.

{% hint style="info" %}
TAs can only be passengers. No driving or navigating. TAs may ask questions but not answer them. TAs will make sure the driver and navigators are following their roles correctly. 
{% endhint %}

### **Back in the main room - 15 minutes**

What did people think about this game? Let’s go around and each group share **one thing** they noticed about it. 

## "Algorithm Recipe" Review \(30 Minutes\)

Last week you should have written a "algorithm recipe". The instructor will pick out a few of the best to read with the rest of the class. We'll see if there are any missing steps!

## Effective Communication \(1 Hour\)

Working remotely \(online\) is different from working together face to face. We will look at how communication works online and get some tips on how to be more effective on this course.

## Presentations \(30 minutes\)

For last week's coursework, you and a partner will have made a presentation about something you learned in the last week. Now is your chance to present it! We'll break into small groups  take turns to present to the rest of your group for **8 minutes**.

Remember that communicating information to others is a really important skill for programmers. Here are some tips for your presentation:

* Look at your camera. Not the squares of faces on your screen. It will look like you are talking directly to your audience
* Make sure you are not on mute
* Speak clearly - check if everyone can hear you
* Try to make it fun!
* Stick to the time. Make sure each of you speak equally. The volunteer will cut you off at 8 minutes!

## Coursework In Perspective \(20 minutes\)

\_\_[_Instructors see here for instructions_](../teacher-resources/instructor-notes-1.md#coursework-in-perspective)\_\_

Although the block-based coding you practised at home solved only simple problems with a simple language, we'll look briefly at four concepts you used which are also at the heart of professional coding.

## Coursework Time \(120 minutes\)

### Help with Coursework Exercises 

This is your opportunity to ask questions about last week's assignments. If you would like some assistance on any of the exercises, the teaching assistants will be available to help.

### 1-to-1 programming problem with an instructor

Whilst you are getting help with your Coursework exercises, each student will have a work with one of the instructors to solve a programming problem using the Code.org block-programming environment.

## Feedback

To make our course better we love to hear your feedback. Please spend two minutes completing this form.

[Class Feedback Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScq8Zgr0pz7aMDj0D768eCpW798XgtDsKfpA6BquqK5Hdtj4A/viewform?embedded=true&entry.1672476057=Fundamentals&entry.74981796=Week+2)

## Coursework Assignments

9. As soon as you complete any "project", make sure you submit it for evaluation immediately, to get feedback.

There will be some time in class to start the first exercises. Let the instructors know if you get stuck.

#### No headphones? Read the subtitles or video transcript

>
> When contributing to the conversation, you might want to consider points such as:
>
> * Should people be held accountable for comments left online?
> * When \(if ever\) might it be important to be able to post anonymously?
> * Is it appropriate that many posts remain online forever?
> * Should an online post be treated the same as a face-to-face comment?
>

### 3. How to improve your workplace communication 

As we work together online it can be even more tricky to communicate effectively. Learn three ways you can improve how you send and receive messages here at CodeYourFuture and in your other workplaces. 

1. Read this [article on communication](https://www.loom.com/blog/improve-your-workplace-communication)
2. Watch the embedded video Karina's Communication and Work Style
3. After reading and watching the video, go back to **Step two: Determine how you communicate.** 
4. Think about the scenarios they present in this section
5. Write down how you would approach each scenario
6. Think about your preferred ways of communicating, the communication tools you rely on, and the things that annoy you about other's communication.
7. Using your answers for the above, try to write your own guide to your Communication style \(just this section, not your whole user manual! \).  Post your guide in your studetn area on Google Classroom You can also have a go at recording a Loom video if you choose. 

### 4. Organise a study session 

Working together is the best way for you to learn. Teaching someone else helps to strengthen your knowledge. And getting help from your fellow students saves you time and keeps you from becoming a passive learner.  

You will be randomly assigned a group using [random list team generator](https://www.randomlists.com/team-generator) 

In small groups of 3, organise a study session to work on one piece of coursework. 

As a group you must decide on: 

1. The topic of the call 
2. The time of call \(give people a few hours to get ready. Remember Slack is asynchronous communication!\)
3. Who will create the link to Google Meet where you will have the call. 
4. Who will open \(start\) the call in Google Meet. 

Once you have decided the above: 

1. Make an announcement in Slack with your topic, time and link to call \(anyone in can join even if they are not in your group. Just keep to just one topic and max 5 -6 people in a call\)
2. Ask people to react if they want to attend
3. If there are too many people - what should you do? Decide on a plan of action
