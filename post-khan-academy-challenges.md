# Make it rain... objects!

Make a spin-off of your "make it rain" project, and change it to store one array of **objects** instead of many arrays.

So instead of `xPositions`, `yPositions`, `speeds`, etc, you'll simply have `raindrops`, and each raindrop will have:
* an `x` property
* a `y` property
...

More ideas:

to each object add more properties:

* a `speed` property
* a `size` property to each object and randomise it at the start.
* a `color` property to each object - you can make a random colour like this: `color(random(255), random(255), random(255))`

* try with squares or rectangles
* try with images.
