## Welcome

The aim of this session is to welcome students to the space and get them settled. You should choose an [Energiser ](engergisers.md)and work through it with you students. 

## Code of Conduct, Student Agreement & Rules

This section is important to cover early in the course so we set our expectations and requirements of our students early.

### Past Slides

### Past Exercises

If you like, you can use the exercises below to help teach this section. You are also encouraged to create your own exercises that are tailored to your students.

The students should select all the words that they don't understand or know the meaning of. 

Consider using a Slack Poll or a [Menti Poll](https://www.menti.com/) to run this exercise.

When the students have voted either have a group discussion with all the students about the top unknown words or split into smaller groups and and have small discussions. 

#### "Uber Code of Conduct" Exercise \(3 minutes\)

Ask the class - What code of conduct rule would this article violate?

[Uber couldnâ€™t get through its meeting about sexism without a board member making a sexist joke](https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/13/15795610/uber-sexist-joke-board-member-david-bonderman-arianna-huffington)

## Kahoot

Kahoot is a web app for running quick, fun quizzes with the whole class.

A prepared quiz is [available here](https://play.kahoot.it/v2/?quizId=62bd599b-af55-41c3-b335-c28c9060c023) \(editor view [here](https://create.kahoot.it/details/62bd599b-af55-41c3-b335-c28c9060c023)\). It is intended to get a general level of confidence in their programming ability from the class. To be able to compare we suggest running it in the first and last classes.

The aim of this quiz is to get to know your students a little and to find out their background. Its important to find out exactly how much your students know before you start teaching. 



## Slack

Create a private channel for the class and invite the whole class to it.

Please use the convention \#CITY-Fundamentals-class number \(eg: \#WestMids-Fund-2\)

## Start Code.org homework in class

It is a good idea to spend some time in the class working through the first few lessons. You can help with problems getting signed in, with the interface, etc.
