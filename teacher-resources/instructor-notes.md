## Overview

This lesson is mostly about welcoming students to the course, letting them know the rules and the course and getting them started with Block Based coding.

Be sure to take attendance at the start of class - this will be an important data point for the Selection for the Full Class.

As this is the first class, make sure you chase up students who are having trouble finding the space or connecting online. There will always be problems for the first class!

## Welcome

The aim of this session is to welcome students to the space and get them settled. You should choose an [Energiser ](engergisers.md)and work through it with you students. 

Be sure to cover

* A short introduction to CYF and what we do
* What the students will be learning on the course
* The roles of people in the classroom, including
  * Teacher
  * Teaching Assistant
  * Personal Development
  * Any CYF Staff Present \(e.g. City Coordinators\)

## Code of Conduct, Student Agreement & Rules

This section is important to cover early in the course so we set our expectations and requirements of our students early.

In this session we're covering these three topics

* The [Code of Conduct](https://codeyourfuture.io/about/code-of-conduct/)
* The [Student Agreement](https://docs.codeyourfuture.io/organisation/agreements-and-rules/student-agreement)
* Our [House Rules](https://docs.codeyourfuture.io/organisation/agreements-and-rules/house-rules) \(or/and any other rules you have for your classroom\)

The aim of these sessions is to have the student engage with the content in an active way. It may not be enough for them to simply read the agreement and sign it - they should understand what each of the rules mean in practice. 

We spend a good amount of time on this on the first day to set the expected behaviour of our students in our community. 

Go through each of them in details and define how they differ from each other. Example talking points are: 

* Our code of conduct is followed by ALL members of our community. All good communities should have one. 99% of people will never do anything against it.
* Our student agreement is what we need of you - we're all volunteers so we need you to meet us halfway. We're going to spending alot of time with you to make sure you succeed. 
* Our House Rules are just so everything runs smoothly - we've learnt from exerperience!

### Past Exercises

If you like, you can use the exercises below to help teach this section. You are also encouraged to create your own exercises that are tailored to your students.

#### "What do these words mean?" Exercise \(5-10 minutes\)

Give this list of words and phrases to the students. 

1. Advocating
2. Non-binary Gender
3. Banter
4. Innuendo
5. Derogatory Comments
6. Instilling Fear
7. Malicious Rumours
8. Consent
9. Perpetrators
10. Exclusion
11. Ostracising People
12. Belittling

To run this exercise

1. Create a post in Slack with each of the above words listed. 
2. Assign an emoji response to each word
3. Instruct students to click the emoji for all of the areas that they completely understand

When the students have voted either have a group discussion with all the students about the top unknown words or split into smaller groups and and have small discussions. 

#### "Uber Code of Conduct" Exercise \(3 minutes\)

Ask the class - What code of conduct rule would this article violate?

[Uber couldnâ€™t get through its meeting about sexism without a board member making a sexist joke](https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/13/15795610/uber-sexist-joke-board-member-david-bonderman-arianna-huffington)

#### "Code of Conduct" Exercise \(5 minutes\)

In the exercise below students should put their understanding of the Code of Conduct into

## Getting into Technology: Why & How \(35 minutes\) <a id="getting-into-technology-why-and-how-35-minutes"></a>

## Kahoot

Kahoot is a web app for running quick, fun quizzes with the whole class.

A prepared quiz is [available here](https://play.kahoot.it/v2/?quizId=62bd599b-af55-41c3-b335-c28c9060c023) \(editor view [here](https://create.kahoot.it/details/62bd599b-af55-41c3-b335-c28c9060c023)\). It is intended to get a general level of confidence in their programming ability from the class. To be able to compare we suggest running it in the first and last classes.

The aim of this quiz is to get to know your students a little and to find out their background. Its important to find out exactly how much your students know before you start teaching. 



## Slack

Create a private channel for the class and invite the whole class to it.

Please use the convention \#CITY-Fundamentals-class number \(eg: \#WestMids-Fund-2\)

## Start Code.org coursework in class

It is a good idea to spend some time in the class working through the first few lessons. You can help with problems getting signed in, with the interface, etc.

### Assigning coursework

At the end of Class, assign the coursework for this week through Google Classroom.
