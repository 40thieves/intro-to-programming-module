# Preparation

There are a series of tasks that you need to complete to be ready to deliver this course

## Tool Setup

### Google Classroom

In the past we've used Google Classroom to manage homework assignment and submission. 

The easiest way to do this is to copy a class from previous years. Ask your class coordinator how to do this.

### Code.org Class

Assigning all students to a Code.org classroom will make it much easier to track their progress. You can follow the instruction [here](https://support.code.org/hc/en-us/articles/115000488132-Creating-a-classroom-section) to get setup.
