## Acrostic Poem

In the morning, students use their own first name to create a short poem. Writing their name vertically, students use each letter to start a line, or be the main word in a line, that describes something about themselves. 

In the afternoon, peers review all poems and try to remember details about each classmate. The instructor then creates a short quiz using the statements posted in different poems. Classmates take this fun quiz to show their knowledge of their peers.

### Example

**N** - **N**ot a fan of pie.  
**I** - I love cookie dough **I**ce cream.  
**C** - I prefer **C**ooking over eating out.  
**O** - My family has an **O**live **O**il ranch.  
**L** - **L**earning is fun for me.  
**E** - I’ve ridden an **E**lephant in Thailand.

## My Weekend in Emojis

Students are tasked with talking about what they did at the weekend using only Emojis. These should then be shared in a thread of Slack or in the Zoom chat.

If you have time, break the students out into small breakout rooms and have them guess what each others were.

If you are more limited for time, choose a few students at random and ask people to guess what their emojis mean. 

### Example

🚶‍♂️🌲🌲🌦 = I went for a walk in a forest and then it rained
