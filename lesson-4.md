# Intro to Programming 4

## Intro to JS continued

We'll continue with the introduction to JavaScript lessons.

## Introduction to the Terminal

So far we've used online tools like CodePen to develop our programs. However this is not how most programmers work. Instead they use several tools on their computers, including the "terminal" or "command line". Using this tool efficiently is an important part of being a programmer.

We'll have a gentle introduction to what the terminal is and how to use it.

## Help with Homework Exercises

Another opportunity to ask questions about last week's homework. If you would like some assistance on any of the exercises, the teaching assistants will be available to help.

## Pairing session

Each student will have a pairing session with one of the instructors to solve a programming problem using JavaScript in CodePen.

## Homework
