# Intro to Programming 4

## Warm up game

Some students will teach zip zap boing to the others.

## Introductions

As you'll have seen during the game, we have new volunteers today!  Let's make sure we know each other!  Ask for a name tag if you don't already have one.

## Shout out your questions

Let's make a list of all of the programming questions we'd like to get answered today, and put them on the whiteboard.

During the break we'd also like you to add your initials next to the questions that interest you the most.

Mentor notes: have a volunteer write up the questions (e.g. as https://gist.github.com/) and share.

[Questions from last week, with answers](questions-week3-neill.md)

## Present your favourite project to your classmates

You will give a very, very simple 2 minute presentation to 2 or 3 other students and a volunteer (if one is available).

5 minutes to prep:

Pick your favourite project (or the one that's most interesting to talk about) and get ready to explain:
* what you added to it
* what was difficult
* what you like and don't like about it
* what you would add if you had time
* Any parts of the code you still don't understand and might want help with

With your table-mates, find a quiet space in the allowed areas, and set a stopwatch for 2 minutes.  First presenter to go ahead:
* Present to your classmates, not just to the volunteer
* cover the above points
* speak clearly
* face the people you're talking to, as much as possible.  Don't just face the screen
* try to make it fun!
* stick to the time.  The volunteer will cut you off at 2 minutes! 
* don't go into too much detail on one point - 2 minutes is NOT much time at all.

## 1-to-1 with volunteers: critical questions for getting unstuck

Soon the teachers will answer common questions, but we'll first spend 15 minutes where you can ask the volunteers with help on serious *questions that have really been blocking your progress* through the khan academy course.

If you have other more advanced questions that aren't blocking you, please don't ask them yet (unless you see that the volunteers are clearly not busy helping with more fundamental issues).  We'll have time later for those questions.

## Live coding - common questions

We'll work as a group to solve some more Khan Academy/Processing.js challenges and to answer some common questions and difficulties. 

The teachers will talk about how they think about the problem while solving it and show the rest of the class. Can you spot the teacher's coding mistakes before they do?

You might be asked to do some of the coding for the class, please contribute and don't worry about mistakes, they are normal! Certainly the teachers will ask you to contribute suggestions for possible solutions - speak up, that is how you help the teacher. There is no one correct way.

*Tip*: Help us: A quiet class with no questions or suggestions is a difficult class for a volunteer to teach.

## Improve your Khan Academy Projects with Arrays and Objects

As last week, pick a favourite Khan Academy project and think about how you would improve it.

If you have finished all of the Khan Academy projects up to and including arrays and objects, [here is a list of further challenges](post-khan-academy-challenges.md).  

These mostly challenge you to return to an earlier project and make a spin-off which uses objects and/or arrays to make it better, cleaner, and to make it easier for you to do cooler things!

We'll be working in small groups or pairs to help make those changes together. The teaching assistants will also be available to help your group if you're stuck.

### Pair-programming (2 students)

It's good to code with a friend. You learn **so** much. Many professional teams program in pairs for a part of each day.

See [lesson 3](lesson-3.md#pair-programming-2-students) for introduction and guidance on pair programming.

Volunteer notes:

* Volunteers to call out to switch navigator and driver roles every 10 minutes loosely
* Don't run the session too long. Stressful for some.

### Pairing session with an instructor

Each student will have a pairing session with one of the instructors to solve a programming problem together.

## Retro: Zombies, plants, fish tanks, draw() function... How is all this relevant in the real world?

Let's do the first Kahoot again. (Instructor's note: [run quiz here](https://play.kahoot.it/v2/?quizId=62bd599b-af55-41c3-b335-c28c9060c023))

Look back at the [roadmap](roadmap-of-concepts.md)

Believe it or not, you've been learning the basics of programming, relevant to a whole range of coding jobs. We'll look at specific elements you've learned about and how they're relevant elsewhere.

Outside of the Khan Academy course, you'll see some differences in JavaScript:

* `let` and `const` used instead of var
* functions can be created many ways (khan academy way is uncommon)
* more features to learn about
* ...

## Other free resources

We'll have a look at some of our favourite free resources - both online and in person - which can help you towards a career in programming and web development.

### In-person events

- Coding "meetups"
    - [JavaScript meetups in London](https://www.meetup.com/topics/javascript/gb/17/london/). Don't be scared of these, just go! There is very often free pizza at these free evening events.

- [Codebar](https://codebar.io/)

### Online

- [freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)
- [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)
- Youtube: Some favourite channels of the recent graduates include [Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLillGF-RfqbbnEGy3ROiLWk7JMCuSyQtX)  and [Wes Bos](https://www.youtube.com/user/wesbos).  
    - Find the teaching and learning style you like, but...
    - ...[be cautious that you are not following tutorials blindly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_aMpyMvQ9k)
- [Free programming books](https://github.com/EbookFoundation/free-programming-books/blob/master/free-programming-books.md#javascript)
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)

### Podcasts

- [CodeNewbie](https://www.codenewbie.org/podcast)

### Editors and hosting

- [CodePen](https://codepen.io/)
- [Glitch](https://glitch.com/)
- [CodeSandbox.io](https://codesandbox.io/)
- [repl.it](https://repl.it/)

### Program stepped visualisation

- [pythontutor.com](http://pythontutor.com/javascript.html) - it does javascript, too.

## Homework

Know what homework you have.  See google classroom for this week's.  Check it every couple of days.

## Continuing with JavaScript Drawing and Animation after this course

If you enjoyed using JavaScript to make drawings and animations, I recommend further study and play with the p5.js library, using (for example) the [openprocessing](https://openprocessing.org) platform (or codepen)).

I have a lot of [notes on moving to p5.js, here](./from-khan-academy-processingjs-to-p5js.md).

Also, we may have time to do [a short (sub-30 minute) workshop moving to p5.js](p5js-and-openprocessing-workshop.md).

### Some places to get inspiration with p5.js

Here is an essay I like by Jason Bailey about "generative art". It has lots of interesting examples which might inspire you:

## End with a game or two
