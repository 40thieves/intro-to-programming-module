# Intro to Programming 4


## Warm up game

Some students will teach zip zap boing to the others.

## Introductions

As you'll have seen during the game, we have new volunteers today!  Let's make sure we know each other!  Ask for a name tag if you don't already have one.

## Shout out your questions

Let's make a list of all of the programming questions we'd like to get answered today, and put them on the whiteboard.

During the break we'd also like you to add your initials next to the questions that interest you the most.

Mentor notes: have a volunteer write up the questions (e.g. as https://gist.github.com/) and share.

## Present your favourite project to your classmates

You will give a very, very simple 2 minute presentation to 2 or 3 other students and a volunteer (if one is available).

5 minutes to prep:

Pick your favourite project (or the one that's most interesting to talk about) and get ready to explain:
* what you added to it
* what was difficult
* what you like and don't like about it
* what you would add if you had time
* Any parts of the code you still don't understand and might want help with

With your table-mates, find a quiet space in the allowed areas, and set a stopwatch for 2 minutes.  First presenter to go ahead:
* Present to your classmates, not just to the volunteer
* cover the above points
* speak clearly
* face the people you're talking to, as much as possible.  Don't just face the screen
* try to make it fun!
* stick to the time.  The volunteer will cut you off at 2 minutes! 
* don't go into too much detail on one point - 2 minutes is NOT much time at all.

## 1-to-1 with volunteers: critical questions for getting unstuck

Soon the teachers will answer common questions, but we'll first spend 15 minutes where you can ask the volunteers with help on serious *questions that have really been blocking your progress* through the khan academy course.

If you have other more advanced questions that aren't blocking you, please don't ask them yet (unless you see that the volunteers are clearly not busy helping with more fundamental issues).  We'll have time later for those questions.

## Live coding - common questions

We'll work as a group to solve some more Khan Academy/Processing.js challenges and to answer some common questions and difficulties. 

The developer volunteers will talk about how they think about the problem while solving it and show the rest of the class.

Can you spot the teacher's coding mistakes before they do?

They might ask you to do some of the coding for the class, please contribute and don't worry about mistakes, they are normal!

Certainly they'll ask you to contribute suggestions for possible solutions - speak up, that is how you help the teacher.  There is no one correct way.

*Tip*: Help us: A quiet class with no questions or suggestions is a difficult class for a volunteer to teach

## Khan Academy Projects

The Khan Academy course includes some _projects_. Pick your 2 favourite projects and think about how you would improve them. Maybe you want to add more food to the dinner plate. We'll be working in groups to help make those changes together. The teaching assistants will also be available to help your group if you're stuck.

### Pair-programming (2 students)

It's good to code with a friend.  You learn SO much.  Many professional teams program in pairs for a part of each day.

See lesson-3 for introduction and guidance on pair programming.

mentor notes:

* volunteers to call out to switch navigator and driver roles every 10 minutes loosely
* don't run the session too long.  stressful for some.

## Zombies, plants, fishtanks, draw() function... How is all this relevant in the real world?

Believe it or not, you've been learning the basics of programming, relevant to a whole range of coding jobs. We'll look at specific elements you've learned about and how they're relevant elsewhere.

## Other free resources

We'll have a look at some of our favourite free resources - both online and in person - which can help you towards a career in programming and web development.

### Physical events
- Coding "meetups"
    - [JavaScript meetups in London](https://www.meetup.com/topics/javascript/gb/17/london/).  Don't be scared of these, just go!  There is very often free pizza at these free evening events.
    - [Learn to code meetups in London](https://www.meetup.com/topics/learn-to-code/gb/17/london/)
- [Codebar](https://codebar.io/)
### Online
- [freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)
- [the odin project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)
- Youtube: Some favourite channels of the recent graduates include [Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLillGF-RfqbbnEGy3ROiLWk7JMCuSyQtX)  and [Wes Bos](https://www.youtube.com/user/wesbos).  
    - Find the teaching and learning style you like, but...
    - ...[be cautious that you are not following tutorials blindly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_aMpyMvQ9k)
- [Free programming books](https://github.com/EbookFoundation/free-programming-books/blob/master/free-programming-books.md#javascript)
### Editors and hosting

- [CodeSandbox.io](https://codesandbox.io/)

## Pairing session with an instructor

Each student will have a pairing session with one of the instructors to solve a programming problem using JavaScript in CodePen.

## Homework

See google classroom for this week's homework.

## More Javascript Drawing and Animation after this course

If you enjoyed using javascript to make drawings and animations, I recommend further study and play with the p5.js library, using (for example) the [openprocessing](https://openprocessing.org) platform (or codepen)).
I've a lot of [notes on moving to p5.js, here](./from-khan-academy-processingjs-to-p5js.md).

### Some places to get inspiration

Here is an essay I like by Jason Bailey about "generative art".  It has lots of interesting examples which might inspire you:

## End with a game or two
