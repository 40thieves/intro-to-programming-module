# Intro to Programming 4

## zombies, plants, fishtanks, draw() function... How is all this relevant in the real world?

Believe it or not, you've been learning the basics of programming, relevant to a whole range of coding jobs. We'll look at specific elements you've learned about and how they're relevant elsewhere.

## Live coding

We'll work as a group to solve some more Khan Academy/Processing.js challenges. The developer volunteers will talk about how they think about the problem while solving it and show the rest of the class.

## Other free resources

We'll have a look at some of our favourite free resources - both online and in person - which can help you towards a career in programming and web development.

- Codebar
- Coding "meetups"
- [freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) and [the odin project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)
- [Glitch](https://glitch.com/)
- Youtube
- [Free programming books](https://github.com/EbookFoundation/free-programming-books/blob/master/free-programming-books.md#javascript)

## Pairing session

Each student will have a pairing session with one of the instructors to solve a programming problem using JavaScript in CodePen.

## Homework

See google classroom for this week's homework.

## More Javascript Drawing and Animation after this course

If you enjoyed using javascript to make drawings and animations, here are some resources I recommend for further study.

#### Daniel Shiffman: "Code! Programming with p5.js"

I recommend Daniel Shiffman's youtube course: ["Code! Programming with p5.js"](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6Zy51Q-x9tMWIv9cueOFTFA).  "p5.js" is another drawing library nearly identical to the "processing.js" library that you've been using in the Khan Academy course (except p5.js is more powerful and now much more widely used than processing.js).

The above course introduces a website called "p5.js web editor" which allows you to quickly write your projects and test them out.  I happen to prefer a different website which does the same thing: https://www.openprocessing.org/

One reason I like this site instead for p5.js work is that it has [a huge gallery of work by other artists](https://www.openprocessing.org/browse/), and you can see all of their code to learn from*!

(* **Don't Panic!** Do not be worried when you find a project that looks amazing but then you look at the code and can't understand it - this is normal.  These projects can become VERY complex and the artists often aren't very concerned about how easy their code is to read.  And code reading is a skill you have to work on.  Take it slow.  Study simpler projects to start with.)

### Some places to get inspiration

Here is an essay I like by Jason Bailey about "generative art".  It has lots of interesting examples which might inspire you:
