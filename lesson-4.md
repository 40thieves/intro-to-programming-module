# Intro to Programming 4

## Microbit Workshop

Microbits are tiny computers that you can program to turn on and off coloured lights and even play music. They are a fun way to learn programming! Neill will give a short workshop on how to use and program them.

## Other free resources

We'll have a look at some of our favourite free resources online and real, which help you towards a career in programming and web development
(london coding "meetups", codebar, [freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) and [the odin project](https://www.theodinproject.com/), [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), [glitch.com](https://glitch.com/), youtube, [free programming books](https://github.com/EbookFoundation/free-programming-books/blob/master/free-programming-books.md#javascript), to name a few)

## Pairing session

Each student will have a pairing session with one of the instructors to solve a programming problem using JavaScript in CodePen.
## Homework

### Udacity: Intro to JavaScript

[Udacity: Intro to JavaScript](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud803) course.


# After this course 

## Going further with Javascript Drawing and Animation

If you enjoyed using javascript to make drawings and animations, here are some resources I recommend for further study.

#### Daniel Shiffman: "Code! Programming with p5.js"

I recommend Daniel Shiffman's youtube course: ["Code! Programming with p5.js"](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6Zy51Q-x9tMWIv9cueOFTFA).  "p5.js" is another drawing library almost identical to the "processing.js" library that you've been using in the Khan Academy course (except p5.js is more powerful and now much more widely used than processing.js).

The above course introduces a code editing website called "p5.js web editor", which allows you to quickly write projects and test them out.  I happen to prefer a different website which does the same thing: https://www.openprocessing.org/

One reason I like this site instead for p5.js work is that it has [a huge gallery of work by other artists](https://www.openprocessing.org/browse/), and you can see all of their code to learn from!  

Do not be worried when you find a project that looks amazing but then you look at the code and can't understand it - this is normal.  These projects can become VERY complex and the artists often aren't very concerned about how easy their code is to read.  And code reading is a skill you have to work on.


## Some places to get inspiration

Here are two essays I like on "generative art".  They have lots of interesting examples which might inspire you:
* ["Why Love Generative Art?"](https://www.artnome.com/news/2018/8/8/why-love-generative-art)
* ["Giving Generative Art Its Due"](https://www.artnome.com/news/2019/4/17/giving-generative-art-its-due)
They are both by Jason Bailey.
