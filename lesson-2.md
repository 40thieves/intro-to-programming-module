# Intro To Programming 2

## Solving problems

Problem solving is a critical skill for programmers, including for experts. Often programmers spend most of their day solving problems in their code. Learning how to solve problems efficiently is an extremely useful skill.

To help develop your problem solving skills, Ben & Melissa from the Honeycomb Works have put together a fun game to work in groups on. Then they will give a presentation about improving your problem solving.

## Homework presentation

For last week's homework, you will have made a presentation about something you learned in the last week. Now is your chance to present it!

We'll break into 2 groups and take turns to present to the rest of the groups. Remember that communicating information to others is a really important skill for programmers.

## Help with Homework Exercises

This is your opportunity to ask questions about last week's homework. If you would like some assistance on any of the exercises, the teaching assistants will be available to help.

## Pairing session

Each student will have a *pairing* session with one of the instructors to solve a programming problem using the Code.org block-programming environment.

## Homework

### Khan Academy: Intro to JS

We will be studying the [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org) Intro to JS course. This will give you an introduction to the JavaScript programming language which we will be using for the rest of the syllabus. To get set up follow these instructions:

1. [Click here](https://www.khanacademy.org/signup) to create an account on Khan Academy
2. Once you've done that, [click here](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming) to open the Intro to JS course
3. Click the "What is Programming?" link to start the course
4. Read the instructions carefully and try to complete the exercises

There will be some time in class to start the first exercises. Let the instructors know if you get stuck.

### The JS Way: Welcome to programming chapter

[The JS Way](https://github.com/bpesquet/thejsway) is a book that is available to read online for free. It is a beginner-friendly introduction to the JavaScript programming language.

[Click here](https://github.com/bpesquet/thejsway/blob/master/manuscript/intro02.md) to read the "Welcome to programming" chapter.

### Write an "algorithm recipe"

Once you've read The JS Way chapter above, you'll see that there is a section about writing algorithms. In the chapter is there is an example of a burrito "algorithm recipe".

Write your own "algorithm recipe" for your favourite food. Make sure you submit it to Google Classroom.
