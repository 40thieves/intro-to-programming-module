# Intro To Programming 2

## Solving problems

Problem solving is a critical skill for programmers, including for experts. Often programmers spend most of their day solving problems in their code. Learning how to solve problems efficiently is an extremely useful skill.

To help develop your problem solving skills, Ben & Melissa from the Honeycomb Works have put together a fun game to work in groups on. Then they will give a presentation about improving your problem solving.

## Homework presentation

For last week's homework, you will have made a presentation about something you learned in the last week. Now is your chance to present it!

We'll break into 2 groups and take turns to present to the rest of the groups. Remember that communicating information to others is a really important skill for programmers.

## Homework in perspective - how is it applicable? 

Although the block-based coding you practiced for homework solved only simple problems with a simple language, we'll look briefly at four concepts you used which are also at the heart of professional coding.

(mentor notes: 15 minutes.  sequence, repetition with loops, conditional execution with if/else, and breaking bigger problems into smaller problems, with functions.  Possibly showing representations in JS).

## Help with Homework Exercises

This is your opportunity to ask questions about last week's homework. If you would like some assistance on any of the exercises, the teaching assistants will be available to help.

## Pairing session

Each student will have a *pairing* session with one of the instructors to solve a programming problem using the Code.org block-programming environment.

## Homework

### Khan Academy: Intro to JS

We will be studying the [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org) Intro to JS course. This will give you an introduction to the JavaScript programming language which we will be using for the rest of the syllabus. To get set up follow these instructions:

1. [Click here](https://www.khanacademy.org/join/WU488UNX) to create an account on Khan Academy within the Intro to Programming class (you must use that link!)
1. Finish creating your account
1. [Click here too](https://www.khanacademy.org/join/YYP65VVP) and click "Join class".  (To enable both teachers to see your progress)
1. Click on Courses under `My Stuff`
1. Choose `Adult learner` and go to the next step
1. Choose `Computer Programming` and continue
1. To the right of `Intro to JS: Drawing and Animation`, press Start
1. Click the "Start" button for the "What is Programming?" lesson
1. Read the instructions carefully and try to complete the exercises
1. Complete as many lessons as you can AT LEAST UP TO THE Writing Clean Code section.

There will be some time in class to start the first exercises. Let the instructors know if you get stuck.

#### No headphones? Read the subtitles or video transcript

If you do not have headphones to watch the videos you can click in the video window on cc (subtitles/closed captions), or underneath the video on `Transcript`.

#### Note to instructors: propagation delay on student progress 

In my experience, student progress often won't be updated on your dashboard until as much as 5-10 minutes have passed.

### The JS Way: Welcome to programming chapter

[The JS Way](https://github.com/bpesquet/thejsway) is a book that is available to read online for free. It is a beginner-friendly introduction to the JavaScript programming language.

[Click here](https://github.com/bpesquet/thejsway/blob/master/manuscript/intro02.md) to read the "Welcome to programming" chapter.

### Write an "algorithm recipe"

Once you've read The JS Way chapter above, you'll see that there is a section about writing algorithms. In the chapter is there is an example of a burrito "algorithm recipe".

Write your own "algorithm recipe" for your favourite food. Make sure you submit it to Google Classroom.

## Concepts roadmap

Here's a [list of some of the main concepts](roadmap-of-concepts.md) we will cover in this course.  You are free to ignore it, but some students find it useful to know where they are.
