# Intro To Programming 1

## Welcome

Welcome to Code Your Future and to the world of programming! Now that you have built a website in CodePen, we'll look at how the basics of how programming works, start writing our own programs and we'll also look at what you can make with programming and what kind of jobs are available to programmers.

## Introduction to Code Your Future

Before we get started with programming we want to learn a bit about you, and you can learn a bit about us.

We'll start with some introductions: so that we can get to know each other. We'll play some games including Zip Zap Bong and Happy Salmon.

## Code of Conduct & House Rules

While you're at Code Your Future, we expect you to follow some rules. This is so that **everyone** has a fun, productive and enjoyable experience.

We'll read through the [Code of Conduct](https://codeyourfuture.github.io/syllabus-master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.html) and [House Rules](https://codeyourfuture.github.io/syllabus-master/others/house-rules.html) together and answer any questions you have about them.

## Getting into Technology: Why & How

Next one of our long-time instructors Jon Sharpe will give a presentation about why you would want to be a programmer.

## What level is the class starting at?

If you've never programmed before, don't worry - you're definitely on the right course!  

We'll do a 5-minute quiz to help us find out the class's level, using the fun app called ["Kahoot"](https://kahoot.it/).

To prepare, please either install the kahoot app on your phone or just visit https://kahoot.it/ on your laptop.

# Software setup

## Slack

1) Install Slack on your laptop (and phone, if possible)
2) Log in to the Applicants workspace
3) Practice making a Slack call with a few classmates, including screencasting.

The *Golden rule of calls on Slack*:
* Whenever you are not talking, your microphone should be muted!

## Google Classroom

To keep track of what homework you need to do and what you have completed we use Google Classroom. To set up your account:

1. Go to [classroom.google.com](https://classroom.google.com)
2. Log in to (or create) your Google account
3. Click the "+" button in the top right, then "Join class"
4. Paste in this classroom code: `06fypk3` and click "Join"

### Submitting homework on google classroom

Once you have joined the class, click the "Classwork" button at the top. You will see the list of Week 1 homework. To submit homework:

1. Click on the piece of homework you have completed
2. Click the "View Assignment" button
3. Click the "Add or Create" button on the right hand side
4. Here you can provide a link to homework that you have completed, or upload a file

Go ahead and submit the first assignment now, "first assignment: what's your favourite music?", so that we can see google classroom is working for you!

## Tips for success

[We have a list of some tips for success on the course](./tips-for-success.md).  We'll discuss some of these next week, and add to these as we progress.

At this point, make sure you understand the first tip - "don't hide when you don't know".

## Homework

As part of your learning journey with CYF you will be expected to work at home on projects that we set for you. This will help you practice what you learn on Sundays and get prepared for next week.

You will always be able to see a list of your homework assignments on google classroom.

For your first week of homework you will mostly be 
* working on a introduction to programming course and 
* preparing a very short presentation for the rest of the class

Here is more detail

### Code.org Course 3

[Code.org](https://code.org) is a website which teaches beginners how to code and gives them lots of practice. We will be completing their "Course 3". To get set up, follow these instructions:

1. [Click here](https://studio.code.org/join/YCGHSP) to join the CYF class on code.org.  This will prompt you to make an account.
2. Once you've registered and joined the class this way, you should be taken to an overview of [course 3](https://studio.code.org/s/course3).
3. Start by clicking on [item 1 from lesson "2. Maze"](https://studio.code.org/s/course3/stage/2/puzzle/1).  (Yes, you should skip lesson 1.)
4. Read the instructions carefully and try to complete all stages of ALL lessons **EXCEPT** the ones below:

Lessons to **SKIP**:
* 1,
* 4,
* 9, 10,
* 18, 19, 20

Once you're finished, press submit in google classroom, and please add a comment mentioning your code.org username.

There will be some time in class to start the first exercises. Let the instructors know if you get stuck.

### Prepare a presentation for the next class

Part of being a programmer is communicating your ideas to other people on your team. To help you practice this very important skill, we want you to prepare a short (5 minutes) presentation about something you learned during the week. You can use [Google Slides](https://www.google.com/slides/about/) if you want to prepare slides (this is optional).

Here is a list of topic ideas which you could present about:

- Why are the "Repeat" and "Repeat Until" blocks useful?
- Why are "Functions" useful?
- Why is the "Conditional" block useful?

If you want to present a different idea, that is fine as well. Then next week, you'll present what you learned to the rest of the class.
