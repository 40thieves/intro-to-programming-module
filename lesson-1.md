# Intro To Programming 1

## Welcome

Welcome to Code Your Future and to the world of programming! Now that you have built a website in CodePen, we'll look at how the basics of how programming works, start writing our own programs and we'll also look at what you can make with programming and what kind of jobs are available to programmers.

## Introduction to Code Your Future

Before we get started with programming we want to learn a bit about you, and you can learn a bit about us.

We'll start with some introductions: so that we can get to know each other. We'll play some games including Zip Zap Bong and Happy Salmon.

## Code of Conduct & House Rules

While you're at Code Your Future, we expect you to follow some rules. This is so that **everyone** has a fun, productive and enjoyable experience.

We'll read through the [Code of Conduct](https://codeyourfuture.github.io/syllabus-master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.html) and [House Rules](https://codeyourfuture.github.io/syllabus-master/others/house-rules.html) together and answer any questions you have about them.

## Alumni Story

One of the House Rules is about how Code Your Future is a community. This means that your Code Your Future experience does not end after the course has finished. One of our previous graduates will talk about their time with CYF, what they achieved and what they learned.

## Getting into Technology: Why & How

Next one of our long-time instructors Jon Sharpe will give a presentation about why you would want to be a programmer.

## Review of Tribute Page

Volunteers will be available to review the "Tribute" web pages created for the application process. If you have any questions about how to improve the page, this is your chance to ask.

## Homework

As part of your learning journey with CYF you will be expected to work at home on projects that we set for you. This will help you practice what you learn on Sundays and get prepared for next week.

For your first homework you will be working on a introduction to programming course and preparing a presentation for the rest of the class.

### Code.org Course 3

[Code.org](https://code.org) is a website which teaches beginners how to code. We will be completing Course 3. To get set up, follow these instructions:

1. [Click here](https://studio.code.org/join/YCGHSP) to join the CYF class on code.org.  This will prompt you to make an account.
2. Once you've registered and joined the class this way, you should be taken to an overview of [course 3](https://studio.code.org/s/course3).
3. Start by clicking on [item 1 from lesson "2. Maze"](https://studio.code.org/s/course3/stage/2/puzzle/1).  (Yes, you will skip lesson 1.)
4. Read the instructions carefully and try to complete the exercises.

There will be some time in class to start the first exercises. Let the instructors know if you get stuck.

### Prepare a presentation for the next class

Part of being a programmer is communicating your ideas to other people on your team. To help you practice this very important skill, we want you to prepare a short (5 minutes) presentation about something you learned during the week. You can use [Google Slides](https://www.google.com/slides/about/) to prepare your slides.

Here is a list of topic ideas which you could present about:

- Why are the "Repeat" and "Repeat Until" blocks useful?
- Why are "Functions" useful?
- Why is the "Conditional" block useful?

If you want to present a different idea, that is fine as well. Then next week, you'll present what you learned to the rest of the class.

## Google Classroom

To keep track of what homework you need to do and what you have completed we use Google Classroom. To set up your account:

1. Go to [classroom.google.com](https://classroom.google.com)
2. Log in to (or create) your Google account
3. Click the "+" button in the top right, then "Join class"
4. Paste in this classroom code: `06fypk3` and click "Join"

### Submitting homework

Once you have joined the class, click the "Classwork" button at the top. You will see the list of Week 1 homework. To submit homework:

1. Click on the piece of homework you have completed
2. Click the "View Assignment" button
3. Click the "Add or Create" button on the right hand side
4. Here you can provide a link to homework that you have completed, or upload a file
